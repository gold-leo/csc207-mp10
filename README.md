**Instructions for use**

The main purpose of this code is to convert a string of text into Braille or convert Braille back into ASCII or Unicode.  

The user must provide exactly two command-line arguments:
- The conversion command (braille, ascii, or unicode).
- The text to convert.
If the user does not provide the correct number of arguments, the program will print "Incorrect number of parameters."
